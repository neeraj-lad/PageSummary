# PageSummary
Chrome extension that summarizes your current page. 

Submission for CapitalOne Software Engineering Summit programming challenge. 

I wanted to make a simple, lightweight extension that would help summarize webpages. Later on I realized how useful this extension can be, and I definitely plan on refining it and creating more features! The following are steps to installing and using the extension. 

You will need a google chrome browser. You can download it [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

# Step 1 - Downloading the extension

We'll need to download the files of the extension to test it out. On the github repo web page, at the right side of the page there will be a "Download ZIP" button. Click the button and a zip file of the extension will be downloaded.

Unzip the file and you'll find the contents of the extension.
